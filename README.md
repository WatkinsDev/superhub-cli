# superhub-cli
CLI interface to the Virgin Media superhub 2 router

Works by scraping the web interface of the router. Currently only supports 
port forwarding, but other functionality should be easy to add.  My router 
lists the software version as V1.01.29, I have no idea what other VM routers 
it will work with.
